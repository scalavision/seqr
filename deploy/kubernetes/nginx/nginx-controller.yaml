# In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an Ingress controller running.
# You need to choose the ingress controller implementation that is the best fit for your cluster.
# More docs can be found here:
#  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress

#  The Google k8s nginx controller is being refactored (https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/tree/master/controllers/nginx), so using
#  the NGINX-provided controller:
#
#     https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/examples/complete-example/nginx-ingress-rc.yaml
#
#  which is more complete.
